# Calculator GUI
## Created by Gavin Uhran

### Instructions of Use
#### Download the 'calculatorGUI.py' and run the file using Python3
Buttons on the calculator serve the purpose of the typical 4-function calculator. Enter an equation using the built-in buttons, then press '=' to calculate the equation. 

### Most recent update: April 25, 2020
#### Using recursion and string manipulation, the '=' button now has functionality!
When pressed, the '=' button will take the user's equation and display an answer!
#### Flawed functionality
The implementation of the '=' button's functionality is still under development. While the parenthesis do currently hold the highest order of operations, no futher order of operations (following PEMDAS) has been implemented. This will be the goal of the next update. Additionally, the method of calculating a response does not throw any error messages to the user. This has been recognized and will also be a major goal in future updates.
#### Improvements to the Square Root Button
The square root button now throws an error messages when appropriate! This was fixed by checking that operation was only being performed on integers and floats.
